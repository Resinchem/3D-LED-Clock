# MQTT Topic Commands and States

### MQTT use is optional, but if desired, a few steps must be taken

See the [MQTT page](https://github.com/Resinchem/3D-LED-Clock/wiki/MQTT-%5C---Home-Assistant-Integration) of the wiki for additional information.

The full list of topic states and commands, and valid payloads, can be found in the MQTT_Topics.pdf file.  Currently, there are over 30 states reported by the clock and over 20 commands that can be issued to the clock over MQTT.
