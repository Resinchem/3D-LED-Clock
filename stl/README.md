# 3D Models

### All models can be printed without supports, **EXCEPT** the ControlEnclosure.stl, which should have supports enabled.

### To build the clock as designed, you will need to print each file by the listed quantity below:

| Qty | .stl File | Descrip | Color |
|:---:|-----------|---------|-------|
| 4 | Bottom.stl | Bottom Plates | Black |
| 4 | Top.stl | Top Plates | Black |
| 1 | Middle.stl | Middle top/bottom | Black |
| 1 | AttachBrackets_x6.stl | Rear attach brackets | Black |
| 1 | Backlid.stl | Back lid cover | Black |
| 1 | Stand_Spacers.stl | Clock Stand | Black |
| 1 | ButtonCase.stl | Push Button Enclosure | Black |
| 1 | ControlEnclosure.stl | Control board box | Black |
| 2 | Segment_hor_x6.stl | Six horiz. digit segments | White |
| 2 | Segment_vert_x8.stl | Eight vert. digit segments | White |
| 1 | Dot_x2.stl | Two dots | White |

Here are the settings I used for the Ender3 Pro:
- Layer Height: 0.2
- Infill: 20%
- Supports: No*
(\*Except for the Control Enclosure, which used supports touching buildplate)

All .stl files original design, except for ButtonCase.stl and ControlEnclosure, by Leon van den Beukel.
